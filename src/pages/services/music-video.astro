    <h3>Why Choose Our Venue for Music Videos?</h3>

    <h4>Multiple Themed Sets in One Location</h4>

    <p>
      Our studio features a variety of professionally designed sets that can
      serve as different scenes in your music video. From urban streetscapes to
      elegant interiors, vintage settings to modern minimalist environments, we
      have backgrounds to suit diverse music styles and concepts.
    </p>

    <h4>Professional Lighting Infrastructure</h4>

    <p>
      Our venue is equipped with mounting points and power capacity for
      professional lighting equipment. While you'll need to bring your specific
      lighting gear, our infrastructure makes setup easy and offers capabilities
      for dramatic effects that would be difficult to achieve in conventional
      locations.
    </p>

    <h4>Sound-Friendly Environment</h4>

    <p>
      Our studio spaces are designed with acoustics in mind, providing good
      sound isolation for performance scenes. The controlled environment
      eliminates background noise and interruptions that often plague outdoor or
      public shooting locations.
    </p>

    <h4>Green Screen Capabilities</h4>

    <p>
      For unlimited creative possibilities, our venue includes a dedicated green
      screen area that allows for custom backgrounds and special effects to be
      added in post-production. This technology enables you to create scenes
      that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive to shoot in real
      locations.

        "Shooting our band's debut music video at Pixxel City was a
        game-changer. The variety of sets allowed us to create multiple scenes
        in one day without moving locations. The lighting capabilities and green
        screen option gave our videographer so many creative options. Highly
        recommend this venue for any music artist."

    <h3>Our Music Video Set Options</h3>

    <h4>Urban Streetscape</h4>

    <p>
      Our street-inspired set creates the look of an urban environment without
      the complications of city permits and public interference. Perfect for
      hip-hop, pop, and rock videos requiring an urban aesthetic.
    </p>

    <h4>Vintage Lounge</h4>

    <p>
      Create a stylish retro atmosphere with our vintage lounge set featuring
      classic furniture and decor elements. This versatile setting works
      beautifully for jazz, indie, acoustic performances, and narrative scenes.
    </p>

    <h4>Minimalist Studio</h4>

    <p>
      Our clean, uncluttered studio space with various backdrop options provides
      maximum flexibility for performance-focused videos where the artist is the
      central focus.
    </p>

    <h4>Green Screen Stage</h4>

    <p>
      Our dedicated green screen area allows for limitless creative backgrounds
      and effects to be added in post-production, opening up possibilities for
      fantastical or otherwise impossible-to-shoot locations and concepts.
    </p>

    <h3>Important Booking Information</h3>

    <p>
      Our venue rental includes access to your selected sets and basic studio
      amenities. Please note that we provide the venue space and infrastructure
      only—you'll need to bring your own videographer, lighting equipment,
      cameras, and sound gear.
    </p>

    <p>
      For music video production, we recommend booking our Premium package (12
      hours) to allow adequate time for setup, multiple scenes, and teardown.
      The extended hours ensure you won't feel rushed and can achieve all the
      shots needed for a professional result.
    </p>

    <p>
      A security deposit of ₹2,000 is required at booking, which is fully
      refundable after your session assuming no damage to sets or facilities.
      Our packages include complimentary water bottles and access to changing
      rooms.
    </p>
