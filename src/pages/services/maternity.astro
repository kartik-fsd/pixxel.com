    <h3>Why Choose Our Venue for Maternity Photos?</h3>

    <h4>Pregnancy-Friendly Environment</h4>

    <p>
      We've designed our studio with the comfort and safety of expecting mothers
      in mind. Our sets feature comfortable seating options, controlled
      temperature settings, easy bathroom access, and a relaxed atmosphere where
      you can take breaks whenever needed.
    </p>

    <h4>Versatile Backdrop Options</h4>

    <p>
      Our venue offers several themed sets that work beautifully for maternity
      photography. From soft, natural light setups to more dramatic and artistic
      backgrounds, we provide varied options to suit different photography
      styles and preferences.
    </p>

    <h4>Privacy and Convenience</h4>

    <p>
      Our studio offers private, spacious changing rooms where you can
      comfortably change outfits during your session. Unlike public locations,
      our controlled environment ensures complete privacy and eliminates
      concerns about weather or onlookers.

        and the sets were beautiful. Having a nice changing room and plenty of
        places to rest between shots made all the difference."

    <h3>Set Options for Maternity Photography</h3>

    <h4>Natural Light Studio</h4>

    <p>
      Our bright, airy set with large windows provides beautiful natural
      lighting that's perfect for capturing the pregnancy glow. Featuring
      neutral tones and minimal styling, this versatile space works with any
      color palette or theme.
    </p>

    <h4>Garden Setting</h4>

    <p>
      Our indoor garden-inspired set offers the beauty of nature without weather
      concerns or walking long distances. With floral elements, greenery, and
      natural textures, this set creates a serene, life-affirming backdrop.
    </p>

    <h4>Classic Studio</h4>

    <p>
      For timeless maternity portraits, our classic studio setup with fabric
      draping, soft lighting, and minimalist design creates elegant silhouettes
      and focused portraits that highlight your beautiful form.
    </p>

    <h3>When to Book Your Maternity Session</h3>

    <p>
      Most maternity photography takes place between 28 and 34 weeks when your
      baby bump is beautifully visible but you're still comfortable enough to
      enjoy the session. We recommend booking your studio time at least a month
      in advance to secure your preferred date.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that our venue provides the beautiful sets and amenities for
      your maternity photos, but you'll need to arrange for your own
      photographer. We're happy to recommend photographers who specialize in
      maternity sessions and are familiar with our studio.
    </p>

    <h3>Important Booking Information</h3>

    <p>
      Our maternity-friendly packages include venue access, set usage,
      comfortable changing facilities, and refreshments. A security deposit of
      ₹2,000 is required when booking, which is fully refundable after your
      session.
    </p>

    <p>
      We offer special weekday rates and quieter time slots that many expecting
      mothers prefer. Our staff is trained to accommodate the needs of pregnant
      clients and ensure your comfort throughout the session.
    </p>
